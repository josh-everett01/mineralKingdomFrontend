    <h1>Mineral Kingdom Privacy Policy</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        At mineral-kingdom.com (Mineral Kingdom), our commitment is to safeguard
        the privacy and security of our customers and site visitors, including
        you. We deeply recognize and respect the significance of data privacy
        and security on the Internet.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the
        collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use the
        service and tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects
        you. We use your personal data to provide and improve the service. By
        using the service, you agree to the collection and use of information in
        accordance with this privacy policy.

      <h2>Collection & Use of Personal Data</h2>
      <p>
        During each site visit, our servers temporarily store access data in a
        protocol file. This data is logged automatically, including the
        originating IP address, date and time of arrival/departure, entry URL
        (landing page), referring website or search engine, pages visited,
        device operating system and browser used, country, and Internet Service
        Provider. This anonymous data is analyzed for statistical purposes, such
        as running site services, network and server optimization, marketing,
        business evaluation, and web analysis through Google Analytics. It also
        aids in the detection and prevention of improper use, such as Denial of
        Service attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon registration, a user-created customer account requires the
        provision of the following data in their own name: email address,
        created username, password, and address. Other data is collected on a
        voluntary basis but stored similarly. This data is necessary for user
        verification, fulfilling contractual obligations, establishing and
        executing contractual relationships between the user and Mineral
        Kingdom, and communication with Mineral Kingdom.
      </p>

      <h2>Passing Data to Third Parties</h2>
      <p>
        We will not pass on your data unless we have received your agreement,
        limited by legal requirements or necessary for the assertion of our
        rights, contractual or otherwise.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Right to Access, Correct & Delete Personal Information</h2>
      <p>
        Personal data is accessible at any time via User Login or in writing
        with acceptable authentication. Modification or deletion of data is
        managed through the User Login or by applying in writing. Account
        deletion would render the use of Mineral Kingdom impossible. Under our
        Terms & Conditions, certain data related to purchases may be excluded
        from deletion, restricted to parties in a contract outside our Privacy
        Policy.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        Mineral Kingdom protects user and other data through technical and
        operational service provision, continuously monitored and updated by us
        and our network providers. User accounts are accessible only through a
        personal password, and it is the user's responsibility to keep passwords
        secure. Mineral Kingdom does not store any passwords or
        debit/credit/bank payment information, ensuring PCI compliance via
        Paypal and Venmo Merchant Services.
