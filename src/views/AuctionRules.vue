    <h1>Auction Rules</h1>

    <section><br>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
       <b>These Auction Rules outline:</b> <br />

        (a) the regulations governing each auction Transaction ("Auction")
        accessible through the Mineral Kingdom Services; <br />

        (b) the specific types of Auction available;<br />

        (c) any particular rules associated with them, and
      </p><p>
        These Auction Rules are legally binding and constitute a part of your
        agreement with Mineral Kingdom. Please refer to our <u><router-link to="/buying-rules">Buying Rules</router-link></u> for
        items offered through fixed-price (non-auction) buying and selling. By
        participating in an Auction, you acknowledge that you have read,
        understood, and accepted these Auction Rules. We may revise these
        Auction Rules periodically, either to include (or exclude) specific
        types of Auctions or to modify the conduct of individual Auctions.
        Therefore, it is advisable to stay updated on their content. Even if you
        regularly engage in buying or selling through Auctions on Mineral
        Kingdom, taking the time to read these rules is recommended. Your
        participation in an Auction signifies that you have done so. These
        Auction Rules should be read in conjunction with the Mineral Kingdom
        Terms and Conditions (the "Mineral Kingdom Terms and Conditions" or
        "Terms"). In case of any inconsistencies, the Mineral Kingdom Terms and
        Conditions, which comprehensively express your rights and obligations,
        will take precedence over these Auction Rules. Terms used in these
        Auction Rules have the meanings assigned to them in the Mineral Kingdom
        Terms and Conditions.

      <h2>Bidding Process</h2>
      <p>
        Bids placed in all Auctions on Mineral Kingdom will be binding. This
        implies that once a bid is placed in an Auction through your Mineral
        Kingdom account (whether by you or someone using that account), the bid
        cannot be withdrawn and becomes legally binding. If your bid is
        successful, a contract is automatically formed between you and the
        Seller when the Auction concludes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to potential internet connectivity issues, the receipt of the
        relevant bid by the Mineral Kingdom system will constitute the bid, not
        the dispatch from the Member's computer or other device. While Mineral
        Kingdom endeavors to process placed bids, it does not guarantee the
        submission of each individual bid.
      </p>

      <h2>Currency</h2>
      <p>
        The base currency for each Auction conducted will be in United States
        Dollars (USD), and amounts due are payable in that currency. The actual
        cost in a buyer's own currency may vary depending on the exchange rate
        applied by the buyer's bank or credit card issuer. Mineral Kingdom is
        not responsible for any variance between this cost and the quoted
        conversion figure.

      <h2>Types of Bids in Auctions</h2>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Auction Bid:</strong> The typical method of participating in
          an online or offline auction, where the highest bid received at the
          end of the auction succeeds, provided it exceeds the reserve price and
          other applicable criteria.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>Proxy Bidding:</strong> Bids are placed through an automated
          Proxy Bidding system. Users enter their maximum bid, and Mineral
          Kingdom bids on their behalf, enough to equal the reserve price (if
          set beforehand) or to beat the high bidder's maximum bid, whichever is
          higher. The maximum bid remains confidential, and the system bids as
          necessary to ensure the user remains the highest bidder.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>Delayed Bid:</strong> This method allows Members to
          participate at the closing stage of an auction without being logged on
          at that time. A Delayed Bid must be registered three hours before the
          scheduled close and adheres to normal bid conditions. The bid is
          automatically entered at the beginning of the auction closing
          sequence. If there are one or more Delayed bids entered, the Auction's
          highest bid level will automatically rise to one increment above the
          second-highest Delayed bid when placed.
        </li>
        <br />
      </ul>

      <h2>Bid Increments</h2>
      <p>
        All bids in all Auctions are set in whole dollar units. The bidding
        system does not accept bids in smaller amounts.
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Auction Bid Level</th>
          <th>Minimum Bid Increment</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Up to $24</td>
          <td>$1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>$25 - $49</td>
          <td>$2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>$50 - $74</td>
          <td>$3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>$75 - $99</td>
          <td>$4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>$100 - $499</td>
          <td>$5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>$500 - $999</td>
          <td>$10</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>$1000 or more</td>
          <td>$25</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h2>Auction Procedures</h2>
      <p>
        Auctions will continue until a specified time after the start of the
        Auction.<br />
        At the end of the Auction at the specified time, the Auction will begin
        its closing sequence.<br />
        Any Delayed bids will be added to the Highest Bid. The Auction will
        accept bids until 10 minutes after the published Close Time has elapsed
        unless a further bid is entered. This process will repeat until 10
        minutes have elapsed after either the Close Time plus 10 elapsed minutes
        or the last bid plus 10 elapsed minutes. At this time, the Auction will
        be deemed closed.<br />
        If the reserve price is exceeded, and unless a "Buy Now" purchase has
        been made, the highest bid received at the scheduled end time will
        succeed. The auction rule of price first, time second applies.<br /><br />
        Some details:
        <ul>
          <li>The person bidding the highest price wins, provided that highest bid is equal to or higher than the reserve price set forth.</li>
          <li>If there is a tie in the price bid, the first bid received on the Mineral Kingdom system wins.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reserve Price</h2>
      <p>
        Any item may be set with a reserve price.<br> 
        A reserve price is a hidden minimum price at which a seller is willing to sell, and if not met when the auction ends, the item is not sold.<br>
        If a bid is placed lower than a reserve price, it will display immediately as "Reserve Not Met," but the bid will increment the auction price. If a proxy bid is placed equal to or higher than a reserve price, the bid will be set to equal the reserve price with the message "Reserve Met." The difference in proxy bid above the reserve price will be stored privately.<br>
        If a Delayed bid is set, it will be placed at the end of the normal auction time and matched to the Reserve Price, and one of the rules above will apply, depending on whether the reserve is met or not.
        <br>
        If a reserve price is not met once the auction ends, it will be listed again until the reserve is met
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Buyer Emails and Notifications</h2>
      <p>
        The Mineral Kingdom system provides automated emails for the convenience of Buyers. Certain emails are mandatory, but Buyers can opt not to receive certain emails through their user profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system provides confirmatory emails for:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>- Notification of acceptance of your bid.</li>
          <li>- Notification of winning Bid or "Buy Now" purchase.</li>
          <li>- Answer from the seller</li>
        </ul><br>
        Optional Emails that can be switched off in Member Profile:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>- Outbid by another Member</li>
          <li>- Delayed Bid Outbid by another Member</li>
          <li>- Auction Clock</li>
        </ul><br>
        Auctions start, continue, and finish according to the time controlled by the Auction system clock on Mineral Kingdom servers.
        <br>
        During the auction process, when a live countdown clock is presented, some timing function is devolved to the User's browser.
        <br>
        Mineral Kingdom will synchronize all timing frequently with all browsers, but we are not responsible for variations or inaccuracies in relative time measured by the User's device clock.
        <br>
        The Mineral Kingdom countdown clock will function if our Cookie has been disabled, subject to the caveat above.<br>
(For more information on Cookies, see our <u><router-link to="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</router-link></u>.)

    <section>
      <h2>Bid Retraction</h2>
      <p>
        Bids must be considered carefully, as all bids on Mineral Kingdom are binding, and retractions are rarely allowed.<br>
        There is no bid retraction in "Buy Now" purchases. Once a purchase is confirmed, an obligation is made to pay the Seller.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Exceptional Circumstances Only</h2>
      <p>
        There are a few exceptional circumstances (described in the <u><router-link to="/terms-and-conditions">T&Cs</router-link></u>) under which a bid may be retracted. These include typographical errors, significant changes to the item's description, or illicit use of a User ID and password.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Timing Rules</h2>
      <p>
        The rules about retracting bids depend on when the bid was originally placed.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>- Before the last 12 hours of the listing: Retraction is allowed before the last 12 hours if it meets the exceptional circumstances description.</li>
        <li>- During the last 12 hours of the listing: Retraction is not allowed.</li>
        <li>- When you retract a bid before the last 12 hours, all your bids on that item will be eliminated. If correcting a bidding error, you must bid again.</li>
        <li>- If you place a bid during the last 12 hours, you may retract it only within one hour after placing the bid (if exceptional circumstances apply).</li>
        <li>- When you retract a bid within the last 12 hours, only the most recent bid will be eliminated; bids placed prior to the last 12 hours will not be retracted.</li>
        <li>- If you are not allowed to retract your bid during the last 12 hours, you may contact the seller to request bid cancellation, at the seller's discretion.</li>
        <li>- Bids may not be retracted within the last hour of an Auction.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Accountability</h2>
      <p>
Mineral Kingdom will monitor bid retractions, and abuse of this feature may result in the suspension of an account.
      </p>
      <p>
        To retract a bid, use the Contact Administrator form on the Item Auction page.

      <h2>Changes and Updates</h2>
      <p>
        We may revise these Auction Rules periodically. It is advisable to stay
        updated on their content. Your participation in an Auction signifies
        that you have read, understood, and accepted these Auction Rules.
