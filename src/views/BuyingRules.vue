    <h1>Buying Rules</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This section outlines the rules governing each transaction ("non
        Auction") conducted through Mineral Kingdom:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          (a) The regulations applicable to transactions on Mineral Kingdom.
        </li>
        <li>(b) The specific types of buying options available.</li>
        <li>(c) Any relevant rules associated with these transactions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These rules are legally binding and constitute part of your agreement
        with Mineral Kingdom. Please refer to our Auction Rules for items
        available through online auctions. By making a purchase, you acknowledge
        that you have read, understood, and accepted these rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may update these Buying Rules periodically, either to include or
        exclude specific types of transactions or products, or to modify the
        buying/selling process. It is advisable to stay informed about these
        changes. Even if you are a regular buyer or seller on Mineral Kingdom,
        taking the time to read these rules is recommended. Your engagement in
        buying or selling on Mineral Kingdom signifies that you have done so.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Buying Rules should be read alongside the Mineral Kingdom Terms
        and Conditions (the "Mineral Kingdom Ts and Cs"). In case of any
        discrepancies, the Mineral Kingdom Ts and Cs, which comprehensively
        express your rights and obligations, will take precedence over these
        rules. Terms used in these Buying Rules have the meanings assigned to
        them in the Mineral Kingdom Ts and Cs.

      <h2>Purchases</h2>
      <p>
        Items selected for purchase are initially added to a "cart system"
        within your account when you click the BUY NOW option. You have the
        option to remove any item selected from the cart. Adding items to the
        cart (by clicking BUY NOW) does not constitute an agreement to purchase,
        nor does it guarantee the item will be sold to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clicking BUY NOW will reserve an item for 10 minutes; if the order is
        not confirmed via checkout, the item becomes available for purchase
        after this period. A binding agreement to purchase is formed when you
        "check out" and make payment, guaranteeing the item as sold to you.
        Checkout can be completed either through payment or by confirming your
        order to the administrator for invoicing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confirmed purchases are binding, meaning that if a purchase is made
        through your Mineral Kingdom account (whether by you or someone else
        using that account), the purchase may not normally be withdrawn and is
        legally binding. A contract is automatically created between you and
        Mineral Kingdom when the checkout process is completed.
      </p>

      <h2>Currency</h2>
      <p>
        The base currency for any listing will be set in US dollars, and amounts
        due are payable in that currency. Other selling currencies can be
        selected for a purchase at the seller's discretion. Payments can be
        settled by mutual agreement between buyer and seller in any currency.
      </p>
      <p>
        For reference, Mineral Kingdom provides conversions into other
        currencies based on the latest available information. While reasonable
        efforts are made to ensure accuracy, the actual cost to a buyer in their
        own currency may vary depending on the exchange rate applied by the
        buyer's bank or credit card issuer. Mineral Kingdom is not responsible
        for any variance between this cost and the quoted conversion figure.
      </p>

      <h2>Purchase Retraction</h2>
      <p>
        All purchases must be considered carefully, as confirmed orders on
        Mineral Kingdom are binding. Once a purchase is confirmed, an obligation
        is made to pay the seller.
      </p>
      <h2>Exceptional Circumstances Only</h2>
      <p>
        There are, however, a few exceptional circumstances (described in the <u><router-link to="/terms-and-conditions">T&Cs</router-link></u>) under which an order may be retracted: <br>
        <ul>
          <li>The description of an
        item you have bid on has changed significantly.</li>
          <li>Someone has made the
        purchase on an item illicitly using your User ID and password.</li>
        </ul>  
      </p>
      <h2>Accountability</h2>
      <p>
        Mineral Kingdom will monitor order retractions. Abuse of
        this feature may result in the suspension of an account.</p> 
        <h2>How to Retract
        To retract an order</h2>
        <p>Please use the Contact Administrator form on the item
        page.
